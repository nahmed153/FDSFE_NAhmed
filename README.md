Repository for class Machine Learning for Time Series Analysis (PHY664)

1) I would like to get familiar with the latest advancements in the field of machine learning/deep learning and also to learn how to use various tools that are useful to peform high quality research/data analysis in a variety of fields.

2) I hope to learn the application of neural networks in the field of climatology (long term climate data analysis)

3) I have a diverse background in terms of working in different roles and work environments. In terms of academic qualifications, I have a strong scientific background. My earlier qualifications are in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering while my current research focus is in Climatology. I believe I have a strong multidisciplinary approach in terms of doing project management as well as problem solving.
